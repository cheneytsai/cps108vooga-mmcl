Place the Tetrominoes to complete rows.
When a row is filled, it will clear and the rows above it will drop down.

Use the arrow keys to manipulate the Tetrominoe as it falls:
UP: Rotate
RIGHT/LEFT: Move
DOWN: Fall more quickly

Each cleared line gives you 40 points.
Clear 10 lines to advance a level.
If the screen fills up, you lose!

Oh yeah, all the Tetrominoes secretly think they're rectangles. You'll see.
