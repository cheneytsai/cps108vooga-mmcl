Try to earn the most points possible by destroying bricks with balls.
Move your paddle left and right using the arrow keys to prevent the ball from
hitting the bottom of the screen.

Hit a brick with the ball to earn 100 points.
Bricks will take anywhere from 1-3 hits before they are cleared.
Some bricks drop powerups:
S: Shrinks the paddle
L: Makes the paddle grow larger
B: Places a new ball

Clear all the bricks to advance a level. Clear all the levels to win!
