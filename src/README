Our time estimation skills had some issues for this assignment.  We had several
times when a member couldn't meet and had to spend time catching that member up.
This was often because of exams, papers, and other unavoidable circumstances.
It was also a much larger scale project than we have worked with before, and 
this results in not all members knowing what is going on...which is fine at
times, but problematic when members have to explore each others code to make
changes.

Students we discussed this project with:
TONS.  First of all, our TA Alex.  Also our dorm was very enthusiastic about
this assignment, and would often come and ask to play the games.  One person in
particular was a great playtester - he always managed to break something new
or reveal a problem that only occurred sporadically.

Outside resources we used:
The Java API was our friend.  We also looked at the Swing tutorial and searched
the internet for some of the background images.  

Essential files to run the program:
Run Main, in the defaultpackage!

Essential resources files:
Don't delete anything in resources!!!  And the images package is also important.

Impression of the assignment:
We generally loved the idea of the project, and when we weren't crunched to meet
deadlines had fun working on it in our spare time, and trying to make the games
work better.  Overall, however, there just wasn't enough time for (the three of)
us to complete this project in its entirety.  We're really sorry it's not what
you expected - but we really tried!

**As you may have noticed Dukeopalypse is in a sad state of affairs.  We added the
stuff that actually shows up for Dukeopalypse so that it would run without errors.**
